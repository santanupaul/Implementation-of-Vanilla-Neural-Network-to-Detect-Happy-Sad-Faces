# Implementation-of-Vanilla-Neural-Network-to-Detect-Happy-Sad-Faces

I have implemented a vanilla neural network from the scratch. The code has provisions for sigmoid, tanh and relu activation functions. Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum is implemented. Hyperparameters are manually tuned for the time being.
